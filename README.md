# BitTerms

BitTerms is an open-source project dedicated to demystifying Bitcoin terminology. We help everyone—from newcomers to experienced users—understand Bitcoin concepts through clear, simple definitions paired with friendly visual illustrations and optional audio explanations.

- **Simple definitions** for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency terms
- **Visual illustrations** to aid understanding and memory retention
- **Technical definitions** for those wanting deeper technical knowledge
- **Audio explanations** (optional) for multi-sensory learning
- **Popular term tracking** to highlight the most searched concepts
- **Community contributions** to continuously expand the term library
