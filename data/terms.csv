Hash,A hash is a shuffled digital fingerprint used to secure Bitcoin data.,,"A hash (or hash value) is the output of a cryptographic hash function. It is a fixed-size string of characters generated from an input of any size. In Bitcoin, hashing is used extensively in mining (proof-of-work) to secure the network, in creating Bitcoin addresses from public keys, and in organizing transactions within blocks using Merkle trees.

Merkle Tree,A Merkle tree is a way to organize and verify lots of Bitcoin transactions using just a few hashes in a Bitcoin block.,,"A Merkle tree (or hash tree) is a data structure used in Bitcoin to efficiently summarize and verify all the transactions within a block. It is a tree-like structure where each ""leaf"" node is a hash of a transaction, and each ""branch"" node is a hash of the two nodes below it. The single hash at the top of the tree is called the Merkle root and is included in the block header. This allows for the verification of a specific transaction's inclusion in a block by only needing a small number of hashes along the path from the transaction to the Merkle root, rather than the entire block.",,,,
Miner,A miner is someone who uses computers to add new blocks and earn Bitcoin rewards,,A miner in the Bitcoin network is an entity (individual or group) that uses specialized computing hardware to perform the computational work required to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain through a process called mining.

This format is important for multi-party signing, offline signing (with hardware wallets), and complex transaction workflows like CoinJoin.",,,,
Pseudonymous,"Bitcoin uses fake names (addresses), not your real name, to keep things private. So only your Bitcoin address is shown.",,"In the context of Bitcoin, pseudonymous means that while transactions are recorded on the public ledger (blockchain) with Bitcoin addresses, the real-world identity of the individuals or entities controlling those addresses is not directly revealed. Users are identified by their public addresses (pseudonyms), which can be changed for each transaction for privacy, but the history of transactions linked to a specific address is publicly viewable.",,,,
Public Key,A public key is like your Bitcoin username/address that you share for others to use to send you Bitcoin.,,"A public key is a cryptographic code that is mathematically derived from a private key. Unlike the private key, the public key is designed to be shared. It is used to generate a Bitcoin address, which is where bitcoins can be sent.

Replace-by-fee (RBF),RBF lets you resend a stuck Bitcoin transaction with a higher fee to speed it up.,,"This is a Bitcoin feature that allows a sender to replace an unconfirmed transaction with a new version of the transaction that pays a higher transaction fee. This is useful when the original transaction is taking a long time to confirm due to a low fee, enabling the sender to incentivize miners to prioritize the new transaction with the increased fee.",,,,
